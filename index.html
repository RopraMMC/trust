			Tudor Grange Academy is an outstanding 11-18 comprehensive school situated in South Solihull with a roll of 1512. The school was inspected by Ofsted in June 2014 who judged it to be outstanding overall and for each of the four main areas, the school was categorised as outstanding. Tudor Grange is committed to delivering a high-quality educational experience for all its students; it is also committed to sharing its experience and expertise with other educational institutions to raise attainment for all students. To this end, we are a National Support School. We have also been awarded World Class School status.
			From September 2011 Tudor Grange has been designated as a National Teaching School. This is a tremendously exciting development and has placed the academy at the heart of the school improvement agenda and we are a key player in the educational change agenda that Teaching School presents.  This offers our staff the chance to flourish, develop and facilitate over courses for other professionals.

			Tudor Grange Academy in Solihull has always been a beacon of excellence. Its focus on continuous improvement and believe that high-quality teaching and learning is at the core of great schools has ensured that it has maintained its outstanding provision year on year.

			Having secured outstanding provision for the students in their care, the Governors of Tudor Grange School, as it was, developed an ambition: every child deserves an outstanding education, not just the children within their school. They supported staff within Tudor Grange to engage fully in a wide range of national and international partnerships focussed on improving provision in schools. The Academies programme then provided an opportunity for them to sponsor a school in challenging circumstances, taking full responsibility for the quality of this provision and therefore potentially enabling them to realise their ambition.

		<h1>Remote Learning</h1>
		<p id="sixp">
			Our Sixth Form is built around a set of core values:<br>
			<li id="sixli">Meeting the needs of every student.</li>
			<li id="sixli">Raising students' expectations of what they can achieve.</li>
			<li id="sixli">Blending tradition with innovation to provide the best we can for all students.</li>
			<li id="sixli">Being inclusive and collaborative and providing a supportive environment where all students can flourish and reach their potential.</li>
			Our aim in the Sixth Form is to build on the outstanding achievements of Tudor Grange Academy by providing continuity of study for students and ensuring high student retention rates, excellent academic results and an excellent record of entry to universities.

			We offer a range of courses and programmes of study in a school environment, enabling students the opportunity to progress to further or higher education, training or employment. Students’ progress and well being are our top priority. We keep a careful check on how students are achieving and we provide comprehensive support and help through our tutor and college system. Partnership between the academy, students and parents is central to the way we work.

			Students are supported in their journey to higher education or training and apprenticeship with a systematic programme of taught sessions, talks and visits. We also have links with local universities including Birmingham, Warwick and Worcester.

			Students are encouraged to engage in a wide range of enrichment activities including working with younger pupils in the Academy, in one of our partner academies, the community, work experience placements and academic enrichment.

			Across the academies we offer a mix of academic and vocational pathways that is inclusive and centred on the needs of students. We spend a great deal of time trying to ensure that students are on the most appropriate courses for them as individuals and we respond with flexibility and understanding to meet students’ needs.
